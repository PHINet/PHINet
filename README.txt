--- Abstract of Work ---

Named Data Networking, a future networking paradigm, allows for features such as the naming of content for identification and routing as well as router-based caching for ubiquitous storage. These features are well suited for an Internet of Things (IoT) which can network identifiable and addressable electronic devices such as sensors that, in an IoT, are often configured in a Wireless Body Area Network. To bridge the gap between research approaches in the area of both Health-IoT and content centric networking, this paper presents the first content centric networking testbed framework called PHINet for experimentation with Health-IoT. PHINet aims to fulfill the following goals: ease of use, seamless scaling, support for testing, development and integration of health services and sensors, support for experimentation with live traffic underneath, and integration of the cloud into Health-IoT. Architecture, design, and implementation of PHINet is presented. Furthermore, through several use cases, we demonstrate the applicability of the proposed work.
