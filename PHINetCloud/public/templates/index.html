                    PHINet is a testbed for Health-IoT over the Content Centric Network (CCN) known as Named Data Networking
                    (NDN). Its creation was primarily motivated by the gap in what was possible and what was desired
                    in terms of studying the implications Health-IoT over a CCN.

                    Below is the project architecture. PHINet, an application-layer, Health-IoT, NDN testbed, runs
                    over the current IP-Based Internet. We integrate an IoT of biometric sensors per client (controlled
                    via Android device), a cloud server for data analytics, and doctors to observe the trends in their
                    patients' health - all over a simulated Named Data Network. Thus we provide a measure of proof
                    for both the viability of NDN and the viability of Health IoT over NDN; all of which comes in an
                    open source testbed for further modification and study.

                <p style="font-size: 120%">Named Data Networking, a future networking paradigm, allows
                for features such as the naming of content for identification
                and routing as well as router-based caching for ubiquitous
                storage. These features are well suited for an Internet of
                Things (IoT) which can network identifiable and addressable
                electronic devices such as sensors that, in an IoT, are often
                configured in a Wireless Body Area Network. To bridge the gap
                between research approaches in the area of both Health-IoT and
                content centric networking, this paper presents the first
                content centric networking testbed framework called PHINet for
                experimentation with Health-IoT. PHINet aims to fulfill the
                following goals: ease of use, seamless scaling, support for
                testing, development and integration of health services and
                sensors, support for experimentation with live traffic
                underneath, and integration of the cloud into Health- IoT.
                Architecture, design, and implementation of PHINet is
                presented. Furthermore, through several use cases, we
                demonstrate the applicability of the proposed work.</p>
