        <hr>
        <br>
        <p>As the Internet has evolved into a content-distribution network, its end-to-end communication approach has become an increasingly poor fit. In recent years, research has begun on a clean-slate, content-centric networking paradigm known as Named Data Networking (NDN). Unlike the current IP-based paradigm, the focus of how data is exchanged in the NDN paradigm is shifted from the use of addressing to the naming and identification of content. This allows individuals who are searching for data to obtain it from anywhere as opposed to requesting it from a specific source. In this work, we investigate the NDN architecture by developing a software-defined networking test bed wherein Android clients and a Cloud-based server communicate over a UDP-backbone that simulates NDN at the application level. This proposed application utilizes a Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) in order to exchange and catalog data recorded from mobile health trackers and then performs interpretation of the data on a cloud-based server. We provide an application architecture that facilitates this content-centric approach in order to perform robust and synchronized data exchange and computation. </p>
